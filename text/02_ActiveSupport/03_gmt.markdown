## UTC or GMT?

Until now Rails has been using the UTC acronym for most things. When the method **to\_s** from **TimeZone** is called, it will print GMT not UTC. This is due to the fact that the GMT acronym is the most common among end users.

If you take a look in Windows control panel where you can choose timezone, you'll notice the acronym used is GMT. Google and Yahoo also have been using GMT within their products.

	TimeZone['Moscow'].to_s #=> "(GMT+03:00) Moscow"
